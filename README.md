# Hyrule Invaders

Hyrule Invaders is a thrilling retro-style shoot 'em up game that combines the classic gameplay of Space Invaders with the rich universe of Zelda. Prepare to defend Hyrule against an onslaught of invading enemies in this nostalgic arcade-style adventure.

## Overview

Armed with a powerful bow and magical abilities, you must fend off waves of relentless enemies descending upon the kingdom.

## Inspiration

I learned a lot about using [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/) & [donburi](https://github.com/yohamta/donburi) by reading through [m110's Airplanes](https://github.com/m110/airplanes).  Code structure, basic component implementation, and assets approach are heavily borrowed. Many thanks m110.
